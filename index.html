                About me:
                <br>
                
                I am a student exploring many different pathways trying to find my real passion. 
                I enjoy learning about business worldwide and how other economies affect the lifestyle in different parts of the world.
                I further also enjoy learning about how the world works in terms of the scientific aspect. 
               <br>
               <br>
                     My hobbies include playing sports and being exposed to different forms of culture in the form of television shows. 
                I enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, table tennis, badminton, running, swimming and further cycling. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A few of the incredible television shows which I enjoy and have played a role in shaping my personality include: 
                “Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Brooklyn 99, The Mentalist and many more. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, I have a massive sweet 
                tooth and cravings for many different food types—one of my favourites being Chicken shawarma from middle eastern cuisine. This section 
                should give you an idea of who I am as a person </p>

            Community work:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I try to get myself involved in the community to help make a difference. 
            I pursue the role of the PDSB student trustee for the 2020-2021 academic year. With this position, 
            I gain knowledge about issues in the education system and advocate for
            student voice; these perspectives help to analyze and break down systemic barriers in the Peel Board. 
            Ensuring equity for people of all cultures. I am fortunate enough to be apart of many committees and taskforces which tackle issues in educations 
            from many aspects and lenses. I also like to be involved with the Student Activity Council
            in school; in this club, we try to host events to get students involved and raise school spirit. 
            In addition to this, I love to volunteer whenever presented the change. weather it is at a local charity event or school events.
            This section should have provided insight as to the work I do in the community based on my passions  </p>
