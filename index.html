Oh, it seems as you have stumbled upon my website! 
This section will provide you with an outline of what to expect while exploring this website. 
You can read about me in the "About me" tab at the top. 
This is where you can read about my interests and things that shape me as a person.
The experience page highlights the technology experience I have. 
Finally, the projects page will slowly be updated to include the projects conducted in my Computer Science class. 
(This website was coded using HTML, CSS and Javascript.)
