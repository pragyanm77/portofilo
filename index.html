                About me:
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a student exploring many different pathways trying to find my 
                real passion. I enjoy learning about business worldwide and how other economies affect 
                the lifestyle in different parts of the world. I further also enjoy learning about how the world 
                works in terms of the scientific aspect. Few hobbies that have stayed constant for me include playing sports
                and being exposed to different forms of culture in the form of television shows. I enjoy playing volleyball,
                basketball, table tennis, badminton, running, swimming and further cycling. Few of the incredible television shows which I
                enjoy and have played a role in shaping my personality include: “Friends, How I Met Your Mother, 
                Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Brooklyn 99, The Mentalist and many more. Finally, I have a massive sweet tooth and cravings
                for many different food types in terms of food—one of my favourites being Chicken shawarma. This section should give you an idea of who I am as a person
                from middle eastern cuisine. </p>

            <br>
            I try to get myself involved in the community to help make a difference. 
            I pursue the role of the PDSB student trustee for the 2020-2021 academic year. With this position, 
            I gain knowledge about issues in the education system and advocate for
            student voice and perspective while analyzing and breaking down systemic barriers in the Peel Board. 
            Ensuring equity for people of all cultures. </p>
