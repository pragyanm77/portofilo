                About me:
                <br>
                <br>
                
                I am a student exploring many different pathways trying to find my real passion. 
                I enjoy learning about business worldwide and how other economies affect the lifestyle in different parts of the world.
                I further also enjoy learning about how the world works in terms of the scientific aspect. 
               <br>
               <br>
                     My hobbies include playing sports and being exposed to different forms of culture in the form of television shows. 
                I enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, table tennis, badminton, running, swimming and further cycling. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A few of the incredible television shows which I enjoy and have played a role in shaping my personality include: 
                “Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Brooklyn 99, The Mentalist and many more. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, I have a massive sweet 
                tooth and cravings for many different food types—one of my favourites being chicken shawarma from Middle Eastern cuisine. This section 
                should give you an idea of who I am as a person. </p>

            Community work:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I try to get myself involved in the community to help make a difference. 
            I have entaken the role of the PDSB student trustee for the 2020-2021 academic year. With this position, 
            I gain knowledge about issues in the education system and advocate for
            student voice; these perspectives help to analyze and break down systemic barriers in the Peel Board, ensuring equity for people of all cultures.
           <br>
           <br> 
            I am fortunate enough to be apart of many committees and taskforces which tackle issues in education
            from many aspects and lenses. I also like to be involved with the Student Activity Council
            in school; in this club, we try to host events to get students involved and raise school spirit. 
            In addition to this, I love to volunteer whenever presented the change, whether it is at a local charity event or school events.
            This section should have provided insight as to the work I do in the community based on my passions.  </p>

            About the videos:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Richard William goes by the speaker name of Prince Ea.
            He is an American-spoken poet, Youtuber, motivational speaker and my role model.
            The two videos listed here are from his youtube channel; they both tackle important topics
            present in our society currently. The first video focuses on labels in society, it is essential to
            understand labels as they affect many people’s views. He promotes the saying, "Labels were Made Up 
            to Divide us." The purpose of this video is to drop labels in society. This is an educational and 
            inspiring work that enhances my thinking. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The second video touches upon the use of technology; media is
            all around us, and technology is more prevalent than ever. Prince Ea talks about "auto-correcting 
            humanity.” These two videos are
            what really got me inspired in speaking. The thought of words being 
            able to inspire so many astounds me    </p>
